DEVELOPMENT LOG

11/13

We began this meeting by deciding more on the info on graphs to fix project proposal.

Our data seems to favor the adjacency matrix due to runtime
Instead of using a hash map, we are planning to use a vector. This may change along the way depending on how it works.


Mapping: 
	- vertices in vector (our data is already sorted by increasing ID)
	- adjancency matrix to store the edge relations between vertices

BFS Purpose:
	- What should we return? We are plannig on using it as more of a tool, so it would depend on what we were doing with it.
	- Will be used in PageRank algorithm
	- Will take in a User ID and output neighbors

Second Algorithm:
	- Graphic output of graph
	- Thinking of the force-directed graph -- use the PageRank algorithm to find the node to center the graph around

Accomplishments Since Last Week:
	- Makefile completed
	- Contract approved
	- Proposal Suggestions Made (addressed in this meeting, will be resubmitted)

Goals for Next Week:
	- begin both algorithms
	- have our proposal approved
